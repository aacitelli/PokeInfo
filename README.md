# PokeInfo

A website that formats information from PokeAPI in a readable format. 



## How does it work?

JavaScript fetch() is used to get a JSON response from PokeAPI. That data is then read and put onto the page using the HTML DOM. 

## What did I learn? 

Started this today, didn't learn much yet lol
